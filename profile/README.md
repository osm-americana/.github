> _The United States of America is such a glorious mess of contradiction, such a crazy quilt of competing themes, such a fecund mishmash of people and ideas, that defining us is pretty much pointless. There is, of course, a kind of faded notion of "Americana", one that concerns Route 66, diners, freak rock formations, and the likeâ€”but even in its halcyon days this "roadside attraction" version of America was never an accurate or nuanced distillation of our massively complicated culture._ <br/><sub>-Hampton Sides, <i>[Americana: Dispatches from the New Frontier](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(book)>)</i> (2004)</sub>

The purpose of the Americana style is to:

- Promote collaboration and common purpose in the American mapping community
- Express the American experience through cartography, taking inspiration from the familiar features of North American paper maps
- Challenge the status quo by showcasing innovation and invention

The Americana style is the first digital map to achieve concurrent, state-specific highway shields arranged along the path of road. Representative highway shield rendering is of considerable cartographic importance to the American community. We do this proudly in an open source project using vector tile technology.

Where the technology to build our map doesn't exist, _we will build it_.
