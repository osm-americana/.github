_A quintessentially American map style_ [ðŸ—º View the map](https://zelonewolf.github.io/openstreetmap-americana/)
## Purpose
The purpose of the Americana project is to:

- Promote collaboration and shared purpose in the American mapping community
- Express the American experience through cartography, taking inspiration from the familiar features of North American paper maps
- Close technology gaps that impede the use of American cartographic principles. Where the technology to build our map doesn't exist, _we will build it_.

The Americana style is the pioneering open-source digital vector-tile map incorporating concurrent, state-specific highway shields and American cartographic design principles. Accurately rendering highway shields holds significant cartographic value for the American community. We take great pride in dedicating this project to the public domain, with the aim of empowering individuals and organizations to freely disseminate familiar concepts in American cartography.
